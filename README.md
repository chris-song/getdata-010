The output file, run_analysis_output.txt, also goes to the current folder

Here're the requirements for this project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
   * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
   * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
   * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
